FONTLOG for the Unna fonts

This file provides detailed information on the Unna Font Software.
This information should be distributed along with the Unna fonts
and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Unna is a transitional typeface, with 4 weight variants, plus matching italics. Its visual character has a neoclassical vertical texture, but Unna shows its own tenderness, through delicate serifs and strong stems. Therefore it is great for literature books. It was designed by Jorge de Buen, who was inspired by his mother’s surname, and developed by the Omnibus-Type Team.

Unna is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages that
use the Latin script and its variants, and could be expanded 
to support other scripts.
