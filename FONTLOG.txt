This information should be distributed along with the Unna fonts

Basic Font Information

Omnibus Type presents a new font: Unna. Her soft look is 
expressed through delicated serifs and strong stems, that 
accentuating the typical neoclassical vertical texture. 
Unna is the surname of the mother of the type designer, 
Jorge de Buen.

Unna is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages that
use the Latin script and its variants, and could be expanded 
to support other scripts.
